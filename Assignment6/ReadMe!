1) Run make to produce class files.
2) Run the bash script(./bashscript) within the bin directory to repoduce the tests from the report in the results 
directory..



  |Arguments for HashProbe:
  |    -p <probing method>, Q for Quadratic probing,set to default set to linear probing.
  |    -k <number of key>, randomly generate a subset of random keys from the data set.
  |    -s <search query>, search keys for the power information for a particular time stamp.
  |    -l <size>, adjust the size of the subset of data being searched through, set to default 500.
  |    -test, Search through keys in keys.txt file and outputs resulst to test folder.    
   
     example:
        java HashProbe -p -Q -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Qudratic Probing to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.
        java HashProbe -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Linear Probing to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.




  |Arguments for HashChain:
  |    -data <data set>, choose .csv file of power values to be read in, set to default cleaned_data.csv. 
  |    -s <search query>, search keys for the power information for a particular time stamp.
  |    -l <size>, adjust the size of the subset of data being searched through, set to default 500.
  |    -test, Search through keys in keys.txt file and outputs resulst to test folder. 
  
      example:
        java HashChain -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Seperate Chaining to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.
