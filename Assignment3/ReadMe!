1) Run make to produce class files.
2) Run the bash script(./bashscript)  within bin to repoduce the tests from the report in the results 
directory..

  |Arguments for HashProbe:
  |    -p <probing method>, Q for Quadratic, C for chaining otherwise set to linear
  |    -k <number of key>, randomly generate a subset of random keys from the data set.
  |    -s <search query>, search keys for the power information for a particular time stamp.
  |    -l <size>, adjust the size of the subset of data being searched through.
  |    -test, Search through keys in keys.txt file and outputs resulst to test folder.    
    example:
        java HashProbe -p -Q -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Qudratic Probing to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.
        java HashProbe -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Linear Probing to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.

  |Arguments for HashChain:
  |    -s <search query>, search keys for the power information for a particular time stamp.
  |    -l <size>, adjust the size of the subset of data being searched through.
  |    -test, Search through keys in keys.txt file and outputs resulst to test folder. 
    example:
        java HashChain -s 16/12/2006/19:00:00, will use Seperate Chaining to build and search for 16/12/2006/19:00:00.
